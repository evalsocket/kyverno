# Kyverno requires a certificate key pair and corresponding certificate authority
# to properly register its webhooks. This can be done in one of 3 ways:
# 1) Use kube-controller-manager to generate a CA-signed certificate (preferred)
# 2) Provide your own CA and cert.
#    In this case, you will need to create a certificate with a specific name and data structure.
#    As long as you follow the naming scheme, it will be automatically picked up.
#    kyverno-svc.(namespace).svc.kyverno-tls-ca (with data entry named rootCA.crt)
#    kyverno-svc.kyverno.svc.kyverno-tls-pair (with data entries named tls.key and tls.crt)
# 3) Let Helm generate a self signed cert, by setting createSelfSignedCert true
# If letting Kyverno create its own CA or providing your own, make createSelfSignedCert is false
createSelfSignedCert: false
